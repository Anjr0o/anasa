# anasa by Andrew Stokes

A task management web application similar to, but definitely not inspired by, asana...

## Details
anasa is a site designed to make todo lists as easy as possible.
The site is extremely easy to access.  Simply go to https://anjr0o.github.io/anasa
To create a new todo, type in the field and press enter.  To mark a todo as complete, click on it.  To delete a todo, click the bottom todo that is already crossed out.

## Technologies Used
anasa uses React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Google Fonts.

## Future Improvement
- Could add a background
- Could add a linkedin badge
- Could add more features to the NavBar like a search bar
